                                            Tyrannosaurus Rex
          Tyrannosaurus Rex, sometimes just called T-rex, is believed to be the largest and most fearsome predator on Earth’s land ever to  have existed. This dinosaur once roamed the Earth in the Crestaceaous period approximately 68 to 65 million years ago.
          As a carnivorous dinosaur, this giant predator most likely ambushed its preys, and devoured them with jaws full of sharp teeth. With its ability to run at an astonishing speed 0f 32 mph (50 km per hour), a perfect slim and stiff tail that gave it an excellent balance and allowed it to make quick turns, equipped this gigantic predator and made it even more deadly, like a killing machine.

                       Green sea turtles are rarely seen on land.They are endangered species with a drastically reduced population.
                       Despite its name, a green sea turtle’s shell is not always green. The shell can be a blend of different colours including brown, dark olive, grey or black. The shell is also smooth and heart-shaped. Green sea turtles actually received their colourful name from the colour of their subdermal (underneath the skin) body fat.
                        Green sea turtles are really big. They can grow to 91-122 cm in length. They are very dense and heavy animals. Despite their size, they are still not the world’s largest sea turtles.
                          Adult green sea turtles are herbivores. The jaw is serrated to help the turtle easily chew their primary food source – sea grasses and algae. Meanwhile, juvenile green sea turtles are omnivores. They eat a wide variety of plant and animal life, including insects, crustaceans, sea grasses and worms.
                           Green sea turtles have ocean water habitats and nesting habitats. Once a green sea turtle hatches and heads into the oceans, it rarely returns to land. Instead, it feeds on off-shore plant blooms around islands and beaches.

                                            Hawksbill turtle is one of the animals which are critically endangered. They become endangered because of two reasons: climate change and human's greed. The climate change causes the loss of habitat and reduce the existance of coral reefs, hawksbill turtle's source of food. Sadly, humans kill this turtle for their flesh and shells, and eat their eggs. Not particularly large compared to other sea turtles, hawksbills grow up to about 1 meter in shell length and 68 kilograms in weight. While young, their carapace, or upper shell, is heart-shaped, and as they mature it elongates. Their strikingly colored carapace is serrated and has overlapping scutes, or thick bony plates. The hawksbill turtle's tapered head ends in a sharp point resembling a bird's beak, hence its name A further distinctive feature is a pair of claws adorning each. flipper. Male hawksbills have longer claws, thicker tails, and somewhat brighter coloring than females. Hawksbill turtles are found throughout the tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They avoid deep waters, preferring coastlines where the sponges they like to feed on are abundant, and sandy nesting sites are within reach. These highly migratory reptiles help maintain a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Hawksbills are omnivorous and will also eat mollusks, marine algae, crustaceans, sea urchins, fish, and jellyfish. Their hard shells protect them from many predators, but they still fall prey to large fish, sharks, crocodiles, octopuses, and humans.14.

                                            Penguins are actually birds, but they are flightless. Their webbed feet and paddle-like wings enable them to do a fast-moving in the water. These sea birds also can stand erect and are often drawn up in long regular rows like soldiers. They walk with a dignified and stately tread that looks so comical.
Penguins are normally associated with extremely cold climates because most of their populations are found on the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost tip of Antarctica, and on sub-antarctic islands. However, a few kinds of penguins live in warmer areas near the coasts of New Zealand, South America, southern Africa, and Australia. There are also small pieces which live in tropics near the equator, mainly in Galapagos Island.
Most species of penguins have black feathers cover their back and head, and white feathers on their belly. They may also have black lines across their upper breast or white spots on their head. They are various in sizes, little pinguin may weigh 1,1 kg and grow 40 cm in height and the largest type penguin emperors may grow 114 cm in height and weighs more than 30 kg.
The penguin’s wings are short, paddle-like flippers which are totally useless for flight. Instead they are used for swimming. Penguins are excellent swimmers which are able to move fast more than 40 km per hour. Their bodies glide effortlessly through the water. When they want get out of the water, they often swim at high speeds and leap out of the water on to land or ice. Such leaps are able to carry them up as far as 1,8 m.
Penguins have short, stiff feathers. These feathers overlap and form a dense waterproof coat that maintains them dry. Some species of penguins have another layer of soft feathers to keep them in warmth and provide insulation at very cold temperatures. The blubber, a thick layer of fat, also enables them to stay warm in water.
Penguins’ diets mostly consist of seafood. They swim near the water’s surface watching for fish, squid, cuttlefish, and crustaceans such as crabs or shrimp. A penguin will dive after its prey when they spot it. A large colony of penguin may consume tons of food a day.

                                            The Platypus
Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Many people call platypus duckbill because this animal has a bill like duckbill. Platypus can also called as watermole or duckmole.
The name "platypus" is often prefixed with the adjective "duck-billed" to form duck-billed platypus, despite there being only one species of platypus. 
Platypus is a mammal, although it has some different characteristic with other mammal. It gives births with laying her eggs, but it still has a pair of milk gland. Although possessing mammary glands, the platypus lacks teats. Instead, milk is released through pores in the skin. The platypus is carnivorous mammal and eats like a small fish, frog, and fish egg.
Platypus has a flat tail and webbed feet. Its weight varies considerably from 0.7 to 2.4 kg, with males being larger than females. Males average 50 cm in total length, while females average 43 cm. Its body covered with a thick, and woolly layer of fur. The platypus has an average body temperature of about 32°C (90°F) rather than the 37°C (99°F).
Its bill is detecting prey and stirring up mud. Usually it ate crustaceans. A platypus has a eyes and head are small. Its eyes contains double cones, which most mammals do not have. It has no ears but has ability to sense sound and lights. Platypus lives in streams, rivers, and lakes.
Female platypus usually dig burrows in the streams or river banks. The burrows are blocked with soil to protect it from intruders and flooding. In the other hand, male platypus does not need any burrow to stay.

Viewed from the right angle, the ornate fins of the lionfish resemble turkey plumage. That's why 'turkeyfish' is one of the many imaginative names people use when referring to the lionfish. Depending on where you live, you may also hear the lionfish called a devil fish, red lionfish, scorpion-cod, zebrafish, ornate butterfly-cod, featherfins, butterfly cod, Indian turkeyfish, soldier lionfish, or poisson scorpion!
Lionfish are native to the Indo-Pacific, but are now established along the southeast coast of the U.S., the Caribbean, and in parts of the Gulf of Mexico.
Since lionfish are not native to Atlantic waters, they have very few predators. They are carnivores that feed on small crustaceans and fish, including the young of important commercial fish species such as snapper and grouper.
How lionfish will affect native fish populations and commercial fishing industries has yet to be determined. What is known is that non-native species can dramatically affect native ecosystems and local fishing economies. Experts are carefully studying these invaders to better understand their role in, and threat to, Atlantic Ocean ecosystems.</a>

The males are generallySightly larger than the females. Flamingos' feathers are usually pinkish red. They also have pink legs anda pink and white bill with a black tip.Different species of flamingos live throughout the world. The American flamingo is the only onethat lives in the wild in North America. Flamingos live in places with low level water such as lagoonsor mudflats or lakes. They like to wade around in the water searching for food. They are very social andsometimes live in large groups of as many as 10,000 birds.The flamingos get most of their food by filtering out the mud and water in their bills to eat insects andcrustaceans like shrimp. They get their pink coloring from the pigment in their food, carotenoid, which isthe same thing that makes carrots orange.Can flamingos fly? Yes. Although we mostly think of flamingos wading in the water, they can fly aswell. They have to run to gather speed before they can take off. They often fly in large flocks.(Adapted from: https://www.ducksters.com/animals/flamingo.php)41. What is the text about?42. What is the habitat of flamingos?43.

This is not stopping the killer whale from pursuing them – it has swum quickly up the shore and tried to catch a seal bysurprise in the surf. In time, the seals will have to return to the sea to catch food for themselves. They feed on a variety of large fish that live off the shore. The large fish in turn feed on smaller fish - sometimes fish of their own species. The smaller fish feed on the larvae of crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. These larvae do not remain on the rocky bed of the sea like their parents, but swim in the sunlit open waters of the sea. They form part of the plankton - a massive collection of tiny animals and algae. The crablarvae, along with all the other tiny animals, eat the algae.The algae do not eat anything. They are plant-like microorganisms belonging to the Protoctista kingdom.Like plants, algae make their own food throughphotosynthesis, and they use energy in sunlight to do it. Itis the energy in sunlight that was trapped in algae andpassed up the food chain that is being used by the killerwhale in Figure 4.3 as it tries to catch another meal."​</a>

In this national park, there are at least four distinct ecosystems in include peat swamps, mangrove forest, freshwater swamps, and mud land. Administratively, this is an area that became part of distrinct Banyuasin and has been named as a national park since March, 19th 2003. This area called the Sembilang because there are so many Sembilang fish or plotosus canius called in Latin. In Banyuasin Peninsula, there is the east coast of South Sumatra and this is the river which is really suitable for water birds. Wet soil conditions and bordered by mangrove forest are the perfect location fot the worm like molluscs, and crustaceans. That is why there are many water birds living there.Some birds species include the Kuntul Cina (Egretta Eulophotes). Trinil Lumpur-Asia (Limnodromus Semipaltus) dan Pedendang Topeng (Heliopais Personata). They are some kind of 30 birds migrating from their main habitat. Those birds live in the Banyuasin peninsula in order to avoid the winter at their main location in Siberia, and the Korean Peninsula. 1. What is the appropriate tittle of the text? 2.

                                            MINTA TOLONG KAK.The horned puffin is named for the characteristic  black projection over the eye. Puffins, like guillemots and murres, belong to a group of seabirds known as auks or alcids. Puffins and other alcids are well adapted for life on the ocean.	Coloration is black on the back, around the neck, and on top of head with a white face, breast, belly, and under the tail. These kind of puffins have orange to red legs and feet. They have dark, hornlike projection from top of eye and thin, dark line from eye to nape. They also have a large, colorful bill. The bill is yellow at base and red at the tip. After breeding season,  undergoes annual molt which takes place in the fall to winter. Colorful outer part of bill is shed, leaving behind the smaller, duller true bill. Face patch is gray and the horn above each eye disappears. Male and female are similar in appearance, but the male is larger. Juvenile appears similar to adult with a smaller, darker bill.	The horned puffins live in a pelagic seabird. They spend much of the year off shore; return to the coast in the summer to nest and raise chicks. During breeding season, they are found along sea coasts, rocky cliffs, and offshore island. Meanwhile, during non- breeding season, they range over adjacent water usually only the edge of the continental shelf. 	The horned puffins capture prey-such as a wide variety of fishes, including juvenile herring, capelin, sand lances, and sometime salmon and the cod,as well as squid, crustaceans, and polychaetes (marine worms) by surface diving. They may dive up to 80 feet (24m) in pursuit of prey. They forages  over water close to breeding colonies, unless iced over. They may carry more than one fish at a time in its bill. The average  catch is about 10 fish, but some may carry more than 60.Questions!How do the birds get their name?What is the color of the wings?What indicates the maturity of the animals?What are their dietary?What is the interesting about these birds?​</a>

                                            Flamingos are large birds that are identifiable by their long necks, sticklike legs and pink or reddish feathers. Flamingos embody the saying "you are what you eat." The pink and reddish colors of a flamingo's feathers come from eating pigments found in algae and invertebrates.Flamingos are water birds, so they live in and around lagoons or lakes. These bodies of water tend to be saline or alkaline. Flamingos are generally nonmigratory, but changes in climate or water levels in their breeding areas will cause them to relocate.Flamingos eat larva, small insects, blue-green and red algae, mollusks, crustaceans and small fish. Their tendency to eat both vegetation and meat makes them omnivores. Flamingos are pink because the algae they consume are loaded with beta carotene, an organic chemical that contains a reddish-orange pigment. The mollusks and crustaceans flamingos snack on contain similar pigment-packing carotenoids. To eat, flamingos will stir up the bottom of the lake with their feet and duck their beaks down into the mud and water to catch their meal.1 .What is the main idea of the text?A .

          Tyrannosaurus Rex, sometimes just called T-rex, is believed to be the largest and most fearsome predator on Earth’s land ever to  have existed. This dinosaur once roamed the Earth in the Crestaceaous period approximately 68 to 65 million years ago.
          As a carnivorous dinosaur, this giant predator most likely ambushed its preys, and devoured them with jaws full of sharp teeth. With its ability to run at an astonishing speed 0f 32 mph (50 km per hour), a perfect slim and stiff tail that gave it an excellent balance and allowed it to make quick turns, equipped this gigantic predator and made it even more deadly, like a killing machine.

                       Green sea turtles are rarely seen on land.They are endangered species with a drastically reduced population.
                       Despite its name, a green sea turtle’s shell is not always green. The shell can be a blend of different colours including brown, dark olive, grey or black. The shell is also smooth and heart-shaped. Green sea turtles actually received their colourful name from the colour of their subdermal (underneath the skin) body fat.
                        Green sea turtles are really big. They can grow to 91-122 cm in length. They are very dense and heavy animals. Despite their size, they are still not the world’s largest sea turtles.
                          Adult green sea turtles are herbivores. The jaw is serrated to help the turtle easily chew their primary food source – sea grasses and algae. Meanwhile, juvenile green sea turtles are omnivores. They eat a wide variety of plant and animal life, including insects, crustaceans, sea grasses and worms.
                           Green sea turtles have ocean water habitats and nesting habitats. Once a green sea turtle hatches and heads into the oceans, it rarely returns to land. Instead, it feeds on off-shore plant blooms around islands and beaches.

                            6. Hawksbill turtle is one of the animals which are critically endangered. They become endangered because of two reasons: climate change and human's greed. The climate change causes the loss of habitat and reduce the existance of coral reefs, hawksbill turtle's source of food. Sadly, humans kill this turtle for their flesh and shells, and eat their eggs. Not particularly large compared to other sea turtles, hawksbills grow up to about 1 meter in shell length and 68 kilograms in weight. While young, their carapace, or upper shell, is heart-shaped, and as they mature it elongates. Their strikingly colored carapace is serrated and has overlapping scutes, or thick bony plates. The hawksbill turtle's tapered head ends in a sharp point resembling a bird's beak, hence its name A further distinctive feature is a pair of claws adorning each. flipper. Male hawksbills have longer claws, thicker tails, and somewhat brighter coloring than females. Hawksbill turtles are found throughout the tropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They avoid deep waters, preferring coastlines where the sponges they like to feed on are abundant, and sandy nesting sites are within reach. These highly migratory reptiles help maintain a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Hawksbills are omnivorous and will also eat mollusks, marine algae, crustaceans, sea urchins, fish, and jellyfish. Their hard shells protect them from many predators, but they still fall prey to large fish, sharks, crocodiles, octopuses, and humans.14.

                            9. Penguins are actually birds, but they are flightless. Their webbed feet and paddle-like wings enable them to do a fast-moving in the water. These sea birds also can stand erect and are often drawn up in long regular rows like soldiers. They walk with a dignified and stately tread that looks so comical.
Penguins are normally associated with extremely cold climates because most of their populations are found on the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost tip of Antarctica, and on sub-antarctic islands. However, a few kinds of penguins live in warmer areas near the coasts of New Zealand, South America, southern Africa, and Australia. There are also small pieces which live in tropics near the equator, mainly in Galapagos Island.
Most species of penguins have black feathers cover their back and head, and white feathers on their belly. They may also have black lines across their upper breast or white spots on their head. They are various in sizes, little pinguin may weigh 1,1 kg and grow 40 cm in height and the largest type penguin emperors may grow 114 cm in height and weighs more than 30 kg.
The penguin’s wings are short, paddle-like flippers which are totally useless for flight. Instead they are used for swimming. Penguins are excellent swimmers which are able to move fast more than 40 km per hour. Their bodies glide effortlessly through the water. When they want get out of the water, they often swim at high speeds and leap out of the water on to land or ice. Such leaps are able to carry them up as far as 1,8 m.
Penguins have short, stiff feathers. These feathers overlap and form a dense waterproof coat that maintains them dry. Some species of penguins have another layer of soft feathers to keep them in warmth and provide insulation at very cold temperatures. The blubber, a thick layer of fat, also enables them to stay warm in water.
Penguins’ diets mostly consist of seafood. They swim near the water’s surface watching for fish, squid, cuttlefish, and crustaceans such as crabs or shrimp. A penguin will dive after its prey when they spot it. A large colony of penguin may consume tons of food a day.

                            11. The Platypus
Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Many people call platypus duckbill because this animal has a bill like duckbill. Platypus can also called as watermole or duckmole.
The name "platypus" is often prefixed with the adjective "duck-billed" to form duck-billed platypus, despite there being only one species of platypus. 
Platypus is a mammal, although it has some different characteristic with other mammal. It gives births with laying her eggs, but it still has a pair of milk gland. Although possessing mammary glands, the platypus lacks teats. Instead, milk is released through pores in the skin. The platypus is carnivorous mammal and eats like a small fish, frog, and fish egg.
Platypus has a flat tail and webbed feet. Its weight varies considerably from 0.7 to 2.4 kg, with males being larger than females. Males average 50 cm in total length, while females average 43 cm. Its body covered with a thick, and woolly layer of fur. The platypus has an average body temperature of about 32°C (90°F) rather than the 37°C (99°F).
Its bill is detecting prey and stirring up mud. Usually it ate crustaceans. A platypus has a eyes and head are small. Its eyes contains double cones, which most mammals do not have. It has no ears but has ability to sense sound and lights. Platypus lives in streams, rivers, and lakes.
Female platypus usually dig burrows in the streams or river banks. The burrows are blocked with soil to protect it from intruders and flooding. In the other hand, male platypus does not need any burrow to stay.

Wet soil conditions and bordered by mangrove forest are the perfect location for the worm like molluscs, and crustaceans. That is why there are many water birds living in there. Some bird species include the Kuntul Cina (Egretta Eulophotes), Trinil Lumpur-Asia (Limnodromus Semipalmatus), dan Pedendang Topeng (Heliopais Personata). They are some kind of 30 birds migrating from their main habitat. Those birds live in the Banyuasin peninsula in order to avoid the winter at their main location in Siberia, and the Korean Peninsula.tolong terjemahkan ke bahasa Indonesia ​</h2><br />

                            13. The Platypus
Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is a semiaquatic mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Many people call platypus duckbill because this animal has a bill like duckbill. Platypus can also called as watermole or duckmole.
The name "platypus" is often prefixed with the adjective "duck-billed" to form duck-billed platypus, despite there being only one species of platypus. 
Platypus is a mammal, although it has some different characteristic with other mammal. It gives births with laying her eggs, but it still has a pair of  milk gland. Although possessing mammary glands, the platypus lacks teats. Instead, milk is released through pores in the skin. The platypus is carnivorous mammal and eats like a small fish, frog, and fish egg.
Platypus has a flat tail and webbed feet. Its weight varies considerably from 0.7 to 2.4 kg, with males being larger than females. Males average 50 cm in total length, while females average 43 cm. Its body covered with a thick, and woolly layer of fur. The platypus has an average body temperature of about 32°C (90°F) rather than the 37°C (99°F).
Its bill is detecting prey and stirring up mud. Usually it ate crustaceans. A platypus has a eyes and head are small. Its eyes contains double cones, which most mammals do not have. It has no ears but has ability to sense sound and lights. Platypus lives in streams, rivers, and lakes.
Female platypus usually dig burrows in the streams or river banks. The burrows are blocked with soil to protect it from intruders and flooding. In the other hand, male platypus does not need any burrow to stay.

                            14. Penguins are actually birds, but they are flightless. Their webbed feet and paddle-like wings enable them to do a fast-moving in the water. These sea birds also can stand erect and are often drawn up in long regular rows like soldiers. They walk with a dignified and stately tread that looks so comical.
Penguins are normally associated with extremely cold climates because most of their populations are found on the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost tip of Antarctica, and on sub-antarctic islands. However, a few kinds of penguins live in warmer areas near the coasts of New Zealand, South America, southern Africa, and Australia. There are also small pieces which live in tropics near the equator, mainly in Galapagos Island.
Most species of penguins have black feathers cover their back and head, and white feathers on their belly. They may also have black lines across their upper breast or white spots on their head. They are various in sizes, little pinguin may weigh 1,1 kg and grow 40 cm in height and the largest type penguin emperors may grow 114 cm in height and weighs more than 30 kg.
The penguin’s wings are short, paddle-like flippers which are totally useless for flight. Instead they are used for swimming. Penguins are excellent swimmers which are able to move fast more than 40 km per hour. Their bodies glide effortlessly through the water. When they want get out of the water, they often swim at high speeds and leap out of the water on to land or ice. Such leaps are able to carry them up as far as 1,8 m.
Penguins have short, stiff feathers. These feathers overlap and form a dense waterproof coat that maintains them dry. Some species of penguins have another layer of soft feathers to keep them in warmth and provide insulation at very cold temperatures. The blubber, a thick layer of fat, also enables them to stay warm in water.
Penguins’ diets mostly consist of seafood. They swim near the water’s surface watching for fish, squid, cuttlefish, and crustaceans such as crabs or shrimp. A penguin will dive after its prey when they spot it. A large colony of penguin may consume tons of food a day.

Viewed from the right angle, the ornate fins of the lionfish resemble turkey plumage. That's why 'turkeyfish' is one of the many imaginative names people use when referring to the lionfish. Depending on where you live, you may also hear the lionfish called a devil fish, red lionfish, scorpion-cod, zebrafish, ornate butterfly-cod, featherfins, butterfly cod, Indian turkeyfish, soldier lionfish, or poisson scorpion!
Lionfish are native to the Indo-Pacific, but are now established along the southeast coast of the U.S., the Caribbean, and in parts of the Gulf of Mexico.
Since lionfish are not native to Atlantic waters, they have very few predators. They are carnivores that feed on small crustaceans and fish, including the young of important commercial fish species such as snapper and grouper.
How lionfish will affect native fish populations and commercial fishing industries has yet to be determined. What is known is that non-native species can dramatically affect native ecosystems and local fishing economies. Experts are carefully studying these invaders to better understand their role in, and threat to, Atlantic Ocean ecosystems.</h2><br />
                        Dilihat dari sudut kanan, sirip hiasan lionfish menyerupai bulu kalkun. Itulah mengapa 'turkeyfish' adalah salah satu dari banyak nama imajinatif yang digunakan orang ketika merujuk pada lionfish. Tergantung di mana Anda tinggal, Anda mungkin juga mendengar ikan singa yang disebut ikan setan, ikan singa merah, cod kalajengking, ikan zebra, hiasan-cod kupu-kupu, bulu bulu, cod kupu-kupu, kalkun India, prajurit lionfish, atau kalajengking poisson! Lionfish adalah asli ke Indo-Pasifik, tetapi sekarang didirikan di sepanjang pantai tenggara AS, Karibia, dan di bagian Teluk Meksiko. Karena lionfish bukan asli perairan Atlantik, mereka memiliki sangat sedikit predator. Mereka adalah karnivora yang memakan krustasea dan ikan kecil, termasuk spesies ikan komersial penting seperti kakap dan kerapu. Bagaimana singa laut akan mempengaruhi populasi ikan asli dan industri perikanan komersial belum ditentukan. Apa yang diketahui adalah bahwa spesies non-asli dapat secara dramatis mempengaruhi ekosistem asli dan ekonomi perikanan lokal. Para ahli secara cermat mempelajari penyerbu ini untuk lebih memahami peran mereka dalam, dan ancaman terhadap, ekosistem Samudera Atlantik.<br />

This is not stopping the killer whale from pursuing them – it has swum quickly up the shore and tried to catch a seal bysurprise in the surf. In time, the seals will have to return to the sea to catch food for themselves. They feed on a variety of large fish that live off the shore. The large fish in turn feed on smaller fish - sometimes fish of their own species. The smaller fish feed on the larvae of crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters. These larvae do not remain on the rocky bed of the sea like their parents, but swim in the sunlit open waters of the sea. They form part of the plankton - a massive collection of tiny animals and algae. The crablarvae, along with all the other tiny animals, eat the algae.The algae do not eat anything. They are plant-like microorganisms belonging to the Protoctista kingdom.Like plants, algae make their own food throughphotosynthesis, and they use energy in sunlight to do it.

In this national park, there are at least four distinct ecosystems in include peat swamps, mangrove forest, freshwater swamps, and mud land. Administratively, this is an area that became part of distrinct Banyuasin and has been named as a national park since March, 19th 2003. This area called the Sembilang because there are so many Sembilang fish or plotosus canius called in Latin. In Banyuasin Peninsula, there is the east coast of South Sumatra and this is the river which is really suitable for water birds. Wet soil conditions and bordered by mangrove forest are the perfect location fot the worm like molluscs, and crustaceans. That is why there are many water birds living there.Some birds species include the Kuntul Cina (Egretta Eulophotes). Trinil Lumpur-Asia (Limnodromus Semipaltus) dan Pedendang Topeng (Heliopais Personata). They are some kind of 30 birds migrating from their main habitat. Those birds live in the Banyuasin peninsula in order to avoid the winter at their main location in Siberia, and the Korean Peninsula. 1. What is the appropriate tittle of the text? 2.

                            26. MINTA TOLONG KAK.The horned puffin is named for the characteristic  black projection over the eye. Puffins, like guillemots and murres, belong to a group of seabirds known as auks or alcids. Puffins and other alcids are well adapted for life on the ocean.	Coloration is black on the back, around the neck, and on top of head with a white face, breast, belly, and under the tail. These kind of puffins have orange to red legs and feet. They have dark, hornlike projection from top of eye and thin, dark line from eye to nape. They also have a large, colorful bill. The bill is yellow at base and red at the tip. After breeding season,  undergoes annual molt which takes place in the fall to winter. Colorful outer part of bill is shed, leaving behind the smaller, duller true bill. Face patch is gray and the horn above each eye disappears. Male and female are similar in appearance, but the male is larger. Juvenile appears similar to adult with a smaller, darker bill.	The horned puffins live in a pelagic seabird. They spend much of the year off shore; return to the coast in the summer to nest and raise chicks. During breeding season, they are found along sea coasts, rocky cliffs, and offshore island. Meanwhile, during non- breeding season, they range over adjacent water usually only the edge of the continental shelf. 	The horned puffins capture prey-such as a wide variety of fishes, including juvenile herring, capelin, sand lances, and sometime salmon and the cod,as well as squid, crustaceans, and polychaetes (marine worms) by surface diving. They may dive up to 80 feet (24m) in pursuit of prey. They forages  over water close to breeding colonies, unless iced over. They may carry more than one fish at a time in its bill. The average  catch is about 10 fish, but some may carry more than 60.Questions!How do the birds get their name?What is the color of the wings?What indicates the maturity of the animals?What are their dietary?What is the interesting about these birds?​</h2><br />

                            31. Flamingos are large birds that are identifiable by their long necks, sticklike legs and pink or reddish feathers. Flamingos embody the saying "you are what you eat." The pink and reddish colors of a flamingo's feathers come from eating pigments found in algae and invertebrates.Flamingos are water birds, so they live in and around lagoons or lakes. These bodies of water tend to be saline or alkaline. Flamingos are generally nonmigratory, but changes in climate or water levels in their breeding areas will cause them to relocate.Flamingos eat larva, small insects, blue-green and red algae, mollusks, crustaceans and small fish. Their tendency to eat both vegetation and meat makes them omnivores. Flamingos are pink because the algae they consume are loaded with beta carotene, an organic chemical that contains a reddish-orange pigment. The mollusks and crustaceans flamingos snack on contain similar pigment-packing carotenoids. To eat, flamingos will stir up the bottom of the lake with their feet and duck their beaks down into the mud and water to catch their meal.1 .What is the main idea of the text?A .
