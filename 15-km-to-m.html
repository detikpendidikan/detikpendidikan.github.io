                                            TOLONG DI ARTIKAN KEDALAM B. INDOSIA YA KAK PLISS..in 1969, the NASA launched apollo 11 to the moon. The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.1.

                                            Tsunami
Tsunami is a Japanese word from a seismic sea wave generated by an undersea earthquake, ladslide, or eruption.
Most tsunamis happen along the Ring of Fire. It is a zone of volcanoes and seismic activity. The zone encircles the Pacific Ocean.
Historically, tsunamis have caused much destruction and death. Since 1819, about 40 tsunamis have struck the Hawaian Islands and since 1883, aboput 20 tsunamis lave struck Indonesia. The last one was on December 26, 2004, which caused over 100,000 deaths.
Recently, tsunamis have struck many cities in Japan on March 11th, 2011. They have killed thousands people and have damaged everything. A tsunami can have width of 100 to 200 km and may spread far across the deep ocean. The speed is as fast as a jet plane. When the wave reaches land it can be very hidh, about 15 m or more.

                                            Tsunami, japanese word meaning " harbour wave, " used as the scientific term for a class of abnormal sea wave that can cause catastrophic damage when it hits a coastline. Tsunamis can be generated by an undersea earthquake, an undersea landslide, the eruption of an undersea volcano, or by the force of an asteroid crashing into the ocean. The most frequent cause of tsunamis is an undersea earthquake. a tsunami can have wavelengths, or widths ( the distance between one wave crest to the next ), of 100 to 200 km ( 60 to 120 mil ), and may travel hundreds of kilometers across the deep ocean, reaching speeds of about 725 to 800 km/h ( about 450 to 500 mph ). A tsunami is not one wave but a series of waves. in the deep ocean, the waves may be only about half a meter ( a foot or two ) high. people on board a ship passing over it would not even notice the tsunami. Upon entering shallow coastal waters , however , the waves may suddenly grow rapidly in height. When the waves reach the shore, they may be 15 m ( 50 ft ) high or more. Tsunamis can also take the form if a very fast tide or bore, depending on the shape of the sea floor. Tsunamis have tremendous force because of the great volume of water affected and the speed at which they travel. Just a cubic yard of water , for example , weights about , one ton. Although the tsunami slows to a speed of about 48 km/h ( 30 mph ) as it approaches a coastline, it has a destructive force equal to millions of tons. Tsunamis are capable of obliterating coastal settlements.

                                            BANTU JAWAB LH KAK PLISS..in 1969, the NASA launched apollo 11 to the moon. The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.Answer the questions below!1.

                                            Tsunami
Tsunami is a Japanese word from a seismic sea wave generated by an undersea earthquake, ladslide, or eruption.
Most tsunamis happen along the Ring of Fire. It is a zone of volcanoes and seismic activity. The zone encircles the Pacific Ocean.
Historically, tsunamis have caused much destruction and death. Since 1819, about 40 tsunamis have struck the Hawaian Islands and since 1883, aboput 20 tsunamis lave struck Indonesia. The last one was on December 26, 2004, which caused over 100,000 deaths.
Recently, tsunamis have struck many cities in Japan on March 11th, 2011. They have killed thousands people and have damaged everything. A tsunami can have width of 100 to 200 km and may spread far across the deep ocean. The speed is as fast as a jet plane. When the wave reaches land it can be very hidh, about 15 m or more.

The tallest statue in the world is statue at Spring Temple Buddha monumentin Henan, China, 128 m.Garuda Wisnu Kencana has been in the making for the past two decades, with the work resuming in 2013 after a 16 year hiatus due to financial woes. Masterminded by a renowned Balinese sculptor I Nyoman Nuarta, the partially-completed statue is already the highlight of the tr, 240-hectare Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park on the island's southern coast. Wisnu's massive upper body, as well as Garuda's head and claws have been attracting scores of local and foreign visitors to the park for a good few years now. While the final monument is made from over 4000 tons of copper, brass and steel, its parts are currently being fashioned by Nuarta at his Bandung workshop in Java before being transported over 1000 km by trucks for installation.Opened in 1997 to house the colossal sculpture, the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park plays host to regular gatherings and events, and features a lotus pond, an amphitheatre and an exhibition area.Source:http://gwkbaliscorrilgaruda-wisnukencana-is-set-to-be​</a>

It is a zone of volcanoes and seismicactivity, 32.500 km ( 24,000mtr) long. The zone encircles the Pacific ocean.Historically tsunamis have caused much property destruction and loss of life. Since1819, about 40 tsunamis have struck the Hawaiian islands and since 1883, about 20 tsunamishave struck Indonesia. The last one was on December 26, 2004 with over 100.000 dead tons.A tsunami can have width of 100 to 200 km and may travel hundreds of kilometersacross the deep ocean. The speed is about 50 to 960 km per hour ( as fast as a jet plane).When the wave reach the land it can be very high, about 15 m high or more.10. What is the most suitable title of the text above?A.

Initially the direction was set on the first navigation mark, next it was set on the second mark and finally the course was set directly towards the island. Thus the route consisted of three straight lines. The speed and the direction of the wind was measured on the boat. The time it took to drive through the first section was t = 3 min, the speed of the wind was measured to be v₁ = 15 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from the East. The second section was driven in time t₂ = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v₂ = 10 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-East. The third section was driven in time t3 = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v3 = 5 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-West. What was the actual speed of the wind? Note. At different sections the speed of the boat may have been different but during one section the speed was constant. The time it took to turn and accelerate is negligible.

It is also the largest Buddhist temple in the world. This temple is located in Borobudur Village, Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. It is approximately 100 km from Semarang, 86 km from Surakarta, and 40 km from Yogjakarta. It was found as a place of worship for the Mahayana Buddhist by Sailendra dynasty in 800 AD. It was first discovered by Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles in 1814. At that time, it was found crushed and buried in the groundOriginally, it has 10 levels with overall height about 42 meters. However, after the reparation, the height of Borobudur becomes approximately 34.5 meters with overall building area is about 15, 129 m². The front side of Borobudur temple is facing eastwards, although each side of the temple has similar form. There are three main levels of the realm in Borobudur. The first level is Kamadhatu (the realm of lust), the second is Rupadhatu (tangible realm), and the third Arupadhatu (formless realm).There are so many reliefs on Borobudur's wall which are about 1,460 panels. These reliefs tell about ancient stories written in Sanskrit language and read by Mapradakisana's way Mapradakisana is a way to read in accordance with the clockwise direction. The way to read the story is starting from the east side of the gate at every level of the temple. There are so many stories written on Borobudur's wall. The first story on the relief is Karmawibhangga which written on the foot of this temple. It tells about karma. Karma is the law of cause and effect obtained by humans. This relief depicts human actions both reprehensible and commendable along with what they will have. The next relief is Laitawistara. These reliefs lined in the stairs on the south side of temple. This relief consists of 120 figures which illustrate the story of the Buddha from birth to become a Buddhist. The last are Jataka and Awadana reliefs. These reliefs tell the story about Buddha before he was bornBesides decorated with reliefs, Borobudur also has so many sculptures which become a symbol of the Buddha embodiment. The statues are sitting cross-legged in the lotus position, and show a certain hand gesture. These are located at Rupadhatu level. There are 432 sculptures which are lined sequentially in every niche of this level. In the first row, there are 104 niches, the second row are 104 niches, the third row are 88 niches, the fourth row are 72 niches, and fifth row are 64 niches. Besides sculpture, Borobudur temple also has stupa. There are 72 stupas at the level of Aruphadatu. Those stupas are spread in the court at this stage. In the first court, there are 32 stupas, in the second court are 24 stupas, and 16 stupas on the third court.Since the discovery of Borobudur temple, there have been so many theft of Buddhist statues. Originally, the amount of Buddha statues was 504. More than 300 statues have been damaged. Most of the statues of Buddha are headless because they are frequently stolen to be used in a museum collection.​</a>

The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.1.

                        Inggris<br /><br />Pada tahun 1969, NASA meluncurkan apollo 11 ke bulan. Awak misi tersebut adalah Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin dan michael allen collins. Tujuan misi untuk apollo 11 adalah Cukup untuk membawa manusia ke bulan dan mundur lagi dengan selamat. Baik NASA maupun awak kapal menyadari pentingnya misi bagi semua manusia, dan mencerminkan hal ini dalam beberapa cara. Patch misi Apollo 11 adalah satu-satunya patch misi dalam sejarah NASA yang tidak memiliki nama individual di dalamnya. Sebuah plakat terpasang di satu kaki modul bulan, bagian dari pesawat ruang angkasa apollo yang mendarat di bulan, membawa peta bumi, tanda tangan presiden Richard Nixon dan ketiga astronot, dan prasasti tersebut, "di sini orang-orang dari planet bumi pertama menginjakkan kaki di atas bulan juli 1969 AD Kami datang dengan damai untuk seluruh umat manusia. "<br /><br />Apollo11 ​​diluncurkan dari cape canaveral, florida, pada tanggal 16 Juli 1969, dan tiba di orbit mengelilingi bulan pada tanggal 20 Juli. Pada orbit ke-14 bulan, setelah delapan jam persiapan untuk mendarat, modul rajawali lunar dilepaskan dari perintah modul Columbia dan turun ke arah kuda betina tranquillitatis (lautan yang tenang). Armstrong mulai secara aktif mengendarai elang saat pesawat itu berukuran sekitar 1500 m (sekitar 5000 kaki) di atas bulan dan 6 km (4 mil) di sebelah timur target pendaratan, bermanuver untuk menghindari batu-batu besar di zona pendaratan. Elang itu menyentuh permukaan bulan dengan sangat lembut sekitar tiga jam setelah memisahkan diri dari Columbia. Armstrong dan aldrin menyiapkan elang untuk segera lepas landas jika keadaan darurat, makan, melewatkan waktu istirahat yang direncanakan, dan mulai bersiap untuk pergi ke permukaan bulan.<br /><br />Pada pukul 10:56 siang waktu matahari timur neil armstrong menjadi manusia pertama yang menginjakkan kaki di bulan, mengucapkan salah satu kutipan paling terkenal abad ke-20: "Itu adalah satu langkah kecil bagi seorang pria, satu lompatan raksasa bagi umat manusia". Aldrin muncul kurang dari 15 menit kemudian.<br /><br />Armstrong dan aldrin mengerjakan operasi permukaan lunar dengan radius sekitar 50 m (160 kaki) dari modul bulan selama sekitar 2 jam dan 30 menit. Pekerjaan mereka mencakup pengumpulan 22 kg (48 lbs) sampel batuan dan sampel tabung inti dan menyiapkan percobaan angin matahari, seismometer untuk mendeteksi bulan, dan sebuah reflektor laser. Sinar laser reflektor yang dipantulkan sinar laser dipecat dari bumi. Hal ini memungkinkan para ilmuwan membuat pengukuran jarak antara bumi dan bulan dengan sangat akurat. Eagle diangkat untuk bergabung kembali dengan columbia setelah hanya 21 jam dan 30 menit di permukaan bulan.<br /><br /><br />

                            6. Tsunami
Tsunami is a Japanese word from a seismic sea wave generated by an undersea earthquake, ladslide, or eruption.
Most tsunamis happen along the Ring of Fire. It is a zone of volcanoes and seismic activity. The zone encircles the Pacific Ocean.
Historically, tsunamis have caused much destruction and death. Since 1819, about 40 tsunamis have struck the Hawaian Islands and since 1883, aboput 20 tsunamis lave struck Indonesia. The last one was on December 26, 2004, which caused over 100,000 deaths.
Recently, tsunamis have struck many cities in Japan on March 11th, 2011. They have killed thousands people and have damaged everything. A tsunami can have width of 100 to 200 km and may spread far across the deep ocean. The speed is as fast as a jet plane. When the wave reaches land it can be very hidh, about 15 m or more.

Tsunami, japanese word meaning " harbour wave, " used as the scientific term for a class of abnormal sea wave that can cause catastrophic damage when it hits a coastline. Tsunamis can be generated by an undersea earthquake, an undersea landslide, the eruption of an undersea volcano, or by the force of an asteroid crashing into the ocean. The most frequent cause of tsunamis is an undersea earthquake. a tsunami can have wavelengths, or widths ( the distance between one wave crest to the next ), of 100 to 200 km ( 60 to 120 mil ), and may travel hundreds of kilometers across the deep ocean, reaching speeds of about 725 to 800 km/h ( about 450 to 500 mph ). A tsunami is not one wave but a series of waves. in the deep ocean, the waves may be only about half a meter ( a foot or two ) high. people on board a ship passing over it would not even notice the tsunami. Upon entering shallow coastal waters , however , the waves may suddenly grow rapidly in height. When the waves reach the shore, they may be 15 m ( 50 ft ) high or more. Tsunamis can also take the form if a very fast tide or bore, depending on the shape of the sea floor. Tsunamis have tremendous force because of the great volume of water affected and the speed at which they travel. Just a cubic yard of water , for example , weights about , one ton. Although the tsunami slows to a speed of about 48 km/h ( 30 mph ) as it approaches a coastline, it has a destructive force equal to millions of tons. Tsunamis are capable of obliterating coastal settlements.

                            10. BANTU JAWAB LH KAK PLISS..in 1969, the NASA launched apollo 11 to the moon. The crews of the mission were Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" aldrin and michael allen collins. The mission objective for apollo 11 was Simply to take humansto the moon and retrun safely. Both NASA and the crew recognized the mission's significance for all humans, and reflected this in several ways. Apollo 11's mission patch is the only mission patch in NASA history to have no individual names on it. A plaque mounted on one leg of the lunar module, the part of the apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon, bears a map of the earth, the signatures of president Richard Nixon and all three astronauts, and the inscription, "here men from the planet  earth first set foot upon the moon july 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."   Apollo11 launched from cape canaveral, florida, on july 16, 1969, and arrived in orbit around the moon on july 20. On the 14th orbit of the moon, following eight hours of preparation for the landing, the lunar module eagle undocked from the command module Columbia and descended toward the mare tranquillitatis (sea of tranquilily). Armstrong began actively piloting the eagle when the craft was about 1500 m (about 5000 ft) above the moon and 6 km (4 mil) east of the landing target, maneuvering to avoid boulders in the landing zone. The eagle touched down on the moon's surface very gently about three hours after separating from the Columbia. Armstrong and aldrin prepared the eagle for immediate liftoff in case of emergency, ate a meal, skipped a planned rest period, and began getting ready to go out onto the lunar surface.   At 10:56 PM eastern daylight time neil armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the moon, pronouncing one of the most famous quotes of the 20th century: "that's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind". Aldrin emerged less than 15 minutes later.Armstrong and aldrin worked on the lunar surface operation's within a radius of about 50 m (160 ft) of the lunar module for about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Their  work included the collection of 22 kg(48 lbs) of rock samples and core tube samples  and setting up a solar wind experiment, a seismometer to detect moonquakes, and a laser reflector. The laser reflector refleced pulses of laser light fired from the earth. This allowed scientists to make very accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and moon. Eagle lifted off to rejoin columbia after just 21 hours and 30 minutes on lunar surface.  The apollo 11 crew retruned to earth on july 24, spalshing down in the pacific ocean about 1.300 km (about 810 mil) southeast of hawaii. The crew spent a lengthy period in biological quaratine to ensure they had not brought any contaminants back to earth, and then spent many months in technical debriefings at NASA and public appearances around the world.Answer the questions below!1.

The gigantic monument of the Hindu God of providence Wisnu riding the mythical bird Garuda is around 120 m high (including a concrete pedestal) and 64 m wide. To put this in perspective, New York's Statue of Liberty stands at 93 m. The tallest statue in the world is statue at Spring Temple Buddha monumentin Henan, China, 128 m.Garuda Wisnu Kencana has been in the making for the past two decades, with the work resuming in 2013 after a 16 year hiatus due to financial woes. Masterminded by a renowned Balinese sculptor I Nyoman Nuarta, the partially-completed statue is already the highlight of the tr, 240-hectare Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park on the island's southern coast. Wisnu's massive upper body, as well as Garuda's head and claws have been attracting scores of local and foreign visitors to the park for a good few years now. While the final monument is made from over 4000 tons of copper, brass and steel, its parts are currently being fashioned by Nuarta at his Bandung workshop in Java before being transported over 1000 km by trucks for installation.Opened in 1997 to house the colossal sculpture, the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park plays host to regular gatherings and events, and features a lotus pond, an amphitheatre and an exhibition area.Source:http://gwkbaliscorrilgaruda-wisnukencana-is-set-to-be​</h2><br />

                            19. 2. A motorboat was driving to an island located directly towards the South at a distance I = 4 km. Initially the direction was set on the first navigation mark, next it was set on the second mark and finally the course was set directly towards the island. Thus the route consisted of three straight lines. The speed and the direction of the wind was measured on the boat. The time it took to drive through the first section was t = 3 min, the speed of the wind was measured to be v₁ = 15 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from the East. The second section was driven in time t₂ = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v₂ = 10 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-East. The third section was driven in time t3 = 1,5 min, the speed of the wind was v3 = 5 m/s and the perceived direction was directly from South-West. What was the actual speed of the wind? Note. At different sections the speed of the boat may have been different but during one section the speed was constant. The time it took to turn and accelerate is negligible. The actual speed and direction of the wind did not change. (A) 10 m/s (B) 12 m/s(C) 14 m/s(D) 18 m/s​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>To solve this problem, we can use vector addition to analyze the motion of the motorboat and the effect of the wind. Let's break down the problem step by step.</p><p></p><p>1. First, let's analyze the first section of the boat's journey. The boat is traveling in a straight line, and the wind is blowing directly from the east. We can represent the boat's velocity vector as v₁b (velocity of the boat in section 1) and the wind's velocity vector as v₁w (velocity of the wind in section 1).</p><p></p><p>2. In the second section, the boat is traveling towards the southeast, and the wind is blowing from the east. We can represent the boat's velocity vector as v₂b and the wind's velocity vector as v₂w.</p><p></p><p>3. In the third section, the boat is traveling directly towards the south, and the wind is blowing from the southwest. We can represent the boat's velocity vector as v₃b and the wind's velocity vector as v₃w.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's calculate the velocity vectors for each section:</p><p></p><p>1. In the first section:</p><p>   - The boat's velocity vector, v₁b, is directly towards the south with a magnitude of 4 km / (3 min) = 4 km/min.</p><p>   - The wind's velocity vector, v₁w, is directly from the east with a magnitude of 15 m/s.</p><p></p><p>2. In the second section:</p><p>   - The boat's velocity vector, v₂b, is towards the southeast, but we don't know its magnitude yet.</p><p>   - The wind's velocity vector, v₂w, is directly from the east with a magnitude of 10 m/s.</p><p></p><p>3. In the third section:</p><p>   - The boat's velocity vector, v₃b, is directly towards the south with a magnitude of 4 km / (1.5 min) = 2.67 km/min.</p><p>   - The wind's velocity vector, v₃w, is directly from the southwest with a magnitude of 5 m/s.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's solve for the magnitude of the boat's velocity vector in the second section (v₂b):</p><p></p><p>To find the magnitude of v₂b, we need to consider the resultant vector of the boat's velocity vector and the wind's velocity vector in the second section. Since the boat's velocity and the wind's velocity vectors are in different directions, we can subtract the wind's velocity vector from the boat's velocity vector to find the resultant velocity vector.</p><p></p><p>v₂b - v₂w = resultant vector</p><p></p><p>The resultant vector represents the actual motion of the boat in the presence of wind. The direction of the resultant vector will be the direction the boat is actually moving in the second section.</p><p></p><p>We can solve for the magnitude of the resultant vector as follows:</p><p></p><p>|v₂b - v₂w| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>We know that |v₂w| = 10 m/s (magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the second section). Let's assume the magnitude of v₂b is "x" m/s.</p><p></p><p>|v₂b - 10| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of the resultant vector will be equal to the magnitude of the boat's velocity vector in the second section.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, we have:</p><p></p><p>|x - 10| = x</p><p></p><p>Simplifying the equation:</p><p></p><p>x - 10 = x  (Since we are taking the magnitude of the vectors, the sign doesn't matter)</p><p></p><p>x - x = 10</p><p></p><p>0 = 10</p><p></p><p>The equation doesn't hold true, which means our assumption that the boat's velocity vector in the second section is "x" m/s is incorrect. This means the boat's velocity in the second section is zero.</p><p></p><p> In other words, the boat is stationary in the second section.</p><p></p><p>Since the boat is stationary, the wind's velocity in the second section must be equal to the boat's velocity vector in the second section, which is zero.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the second section (v₂w) is 0 m/s.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's move on to the third section:</p><p></p><p>The boat's velocity vector in the third section, v₃b, is directly towards the south with a magnitude of 2.67 km/min. The wind's velocity vector in the third section, v₃w, is directly from the southwest with a magnitude of 5 m/s.</p><p></p><p>We can see that the boat's velocity vector and the wind's velocity vector in the third section are in opposite directions. Therefore, we can subtract the magnitudes of these vectors to find the magnitude of the resultant vector:</p><p></p><p>|v₃b - v₃w| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>|2.67 - 5| = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>2.33 = |resultant vector|</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of the resultant vector will be equal to the magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the third section.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the magnitude of the wind's velocity vector in the third section (v₃w) is 2.33 m/s.</p><p></p><p>To find the actual speed of the wind, we can take the average of the wind's velocity magnitudes in the three sections:</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed = (v₁w + v₂w + v₃w) / 3</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed = (15 + 0 + 2.33) / 3</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed = 17.33 / 3</p><p></p><p>Average wind speed ≈ 5.78 m/s</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the actual speed of the wind is approximately 5.78 m/s.</p><p></p><p>None of the answer choices provided exactly matches this result, but the closest option is (A) 10 m/s.</p><br />

                            20. tolong bantu jawab soal di atas  dengan benarteks nyaBorobudur TempleBorobudur temple is a temple which became a pride of Indonesian people because it has ever included into the 7 wonders of the world. It is also the largest Buddhist temple in the world. This temple is located in Borobudur Village, Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. It is approximately 100 km from Semarang, 86 km from Surakarta, and 40 km from Yogjakarta. It was found as a place of worship for the Mahayana Buddhist by Sailendra dynasty in 800 AD. It was first discovered by Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles in 1814. At that time, it was found crushed and buried in the groundOriginally, it has 10 levels with overall height about 42 meters. However, after the reparation, the height of Borobudur becomes approximately 34.5 meters with overall building area is about 15, 129 m². The front side of Borobudur temple is facing eastwards, although each side of the temple has similar form. There are three main levels of the realm in Borobudur. The first level is Kamadhatu (the realm of lust), the second is Rupadhatu (tangible realm), and the third Arupadhatu (formless realm).There are so many reliefs on Borobudur's wall which are about 1,460 panels. These reliefs tell about ancient stories written in Sanskrit language and read by Mapradakisana's way Mapradakisana is a way to read in accordance with the clockwise direction. The way to read the story is starting from the east side of the gate at every level of the temple. There are so many stories written on Borobudur's wall. The first story on the relief is Karmawibhangga which written on the foot of this temple. It tells about karma. Karma is the law of cause and effect obtained by humans. This relief depicts human actions both reprehensible and commendable along with what they will have. The next relief is Laitawistara. These reliefs lined in the stairs on the south side of temple. This relief consists of 120 figures which illustrate the story of the Buddha from birth to become a Buddhist. The last are Jataka and Awadana reliefs. These reliefs tell the story about Buddha before he was bornBesides decorated with reliefs, Borobudur also has so many sculptures which become a symbol of the Buddha embodiment. The statues are sitting cross-legged in the lotus position, and show a certain hand gesture. These are located at Rupadhatu level. There are 432 sculptures which are lined sequentially in every niche of this level. In the first row, there are 104 niches, the second row are 104 niches, the third row are 88 niches, the fourth row are 72 niches, and fifth row are 64 niches. Besides sculpture, Borobudur temple also has stupa. There are 72 stupas at the level of Aruphadatu. Those stupas are spread in the court at this stage. In the first court, there are 32 stupas, in the second court are 24 stupas, and 16 stupas on the third court.Since the discovery of Borobudur temple, there have been so many theft of Buddhist statues. Originally, the amount of Buddha statues was 504. More than 300 statues have been damaged. Most of the statues of Buddha are headless because they are frequently stolen to be used in a museum collection.​</h2><br />
